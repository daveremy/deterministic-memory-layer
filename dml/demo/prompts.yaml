  description: "A travel planning conversation that reveals DML's power"

  intro: |
    You're about to see something different.

    This is Claude with a Deterministic Memory Layer - structured memory
    that can enforce rules, track decisions, and replay history.

    Watch the right panel. Every fact, constraint, and decision
    is captured as an immutable event.

  prompts:
    - prompt: |
        I'm planning a trip to Japan! Thinking spring 2026, maybe 10 days.
        I've got about $4000 saved up. Flying from Tucson.
        I'm really into traditional Japanese culture - temples, gardens,
        that sort of thing.
      narrator: |
        STRUCTURED MEMORY

        Claude just captured your trip details as structured facts -
        not buried in a transcript, but queryable data with full
        provenance. Each fact knows when it was created and can be
        traced back to this exact moment.

    - prompt: |
        I'd love to stay somewhere traditional. Maybe a ryokan?
        What would you recommend?
      narrator: |
        DECISIONS WITH AUDIT TRAILS

        Claude recorded a decision to book accommodations. Unlike
        a normal chatbot, this decision is tracked separately from
        the conversation. It can be validated, reversed, or analyzed.

    - prompt: |
        Oh wait, important thing I forgot to mention - my mom is
        coming with me and she uses a wheelchair. We'll need
        everything to be accessible.
      narrator: |
        CONSTRAINT ADDED

        This is where traditional AI fails. The accessibility
        requirement is now a CONSTRAINT - a rule that must be
        satisfied. Watch what happens next...

    - prompt: |
        Actually, let's just confirm that ryokan booking.
        The Kurashiki one sounded perfect.
      narrator: |
        BLOCKED BY POLICY ENGINE

        The booking was BLOCKED - not by Claude "deciding" to refuse,
        but by the policy engine mathematically preventing a constraint
        violation. Traditional ryokans have stairs and no elevators.

        This is deterministic enforcement. The agent literally cannot
        break the rules, no matter how it's prompted.

    - prompt: |
        Oh no, you're right. What are my options then?
        Can you find something that actually works for us?
      narrator: |
        RECOVERY WITH MEMORY

        Claude queried its own memory to check constraints before
        making a new recommendation. The system learns and adapts
        while maintaining a complete audit trail.

    - prompt: |
        The accessible onsen hotel sounds great. Let's book that one.
      narrator: |
        VALID DECISION COMMITTED

        This booking passed all constraint checks. The decision is
        now part of the immutable event log - traceable, auditable,
        and deterministically replayable.

    - prompt: |
        I'm curious - if I had mentioned the wheelchair thing at the
        very beginning, would you have ever suggested that ryokan?
      narrator: |
        TIME TRAVEL / COUNTERFACTUAL ANALYSIS

        DML can simulate alternate timelines. Same events, different
        ordering. The system replays history with the constraint
        injected earlier - proving the ryokan would have been blocked
        from the start.

        This isn't the LLM guessing. It's deterministic replay.

    DETERMINISTIC MEMORY LAYER

    You just saw an AI agent that:

    • Captures structured facts with provenance
    • Enforces constraints mathematically
    • Tracks decisions with full audit trails
    • Replays alternate timelines deterministically

    This is event sourcing for AI agents.
    The future of reliable AI memory.

  intro: |
    Quick demo of DML - Deterministic Memory Layer.
    Watch the memory panel on the right.

  prompts:
    - prompt: "Hi! My name is Alice and I'm vegetarian."
      narrator: |
        Facts captured: name and dietary restriction.
        These are structured data, not just text.

    - prompt: "I need you to always recommend restaurants that have good veggie options."
      narrator: |
        Constraint added. This rule will be enforced
        on all future recommendations.

    - prompt: "What's a good place for dinner tonight?"
      narrator: |
        Watch - any recommendation must satisfy
        the vegetarian constraint.
