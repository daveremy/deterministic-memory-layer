  intro: |
    This is a LIVE demo - real Claude, real responses.

    Claude is connected to the DML MCP server and using the DML skill.
    The prompts are scripted, but Claude's responses are not.
    Every tool call you see is actually happening.

    DML gives Claude structured memory that can:
    - Capture facts with full provenance
    - Enforce constraints mathematically
    - Track decisions with audit trails
    - Replay alternate timelines

    Watch the right panel update in real-time as Claude records
    facts, constraints, and decisions.

  prompts:
    - prompt: |
        I'm planning a trip to Japan! Thinking spring 2026, maybe 10 days.
        I've got about $4000 saved up. Flying from Tucson.
        I'm really into traditional Japanese culture - temples, gardens,
        that sort of thing. Can you record all that?
      narrator: |
        STRUCTURED MEMORY

        Claude captured your trip details as structured facts -
        not buried in a transcript, but queryable data with full
        provenance. Each fact knows when it was created and can
        be traced back to this exact moment.

    - prompt: |
        I definitely want the authentic experience - a traditional ryokan
        with tatami rooms and onsen baths. Find me a good one in Kyoto
        and book it. I trust your judgment!
      narrator: |
        DECISION RECORDED

        Claude made a booking decision and recorded it. Unlike a normal
        chatbot, this decision is tracked separately - it can be
        validated against constraints, reversed, or analyzed later.

        Watch the Decisions panel on the right.

    - prompt: |
        Oh wait, important thing - my mom is coming with me and she
        uses a wheelchair. Add a constraint that everything must be
        wheelchair accessible. This is a hard requirement.
      narrator: |
        CONSTRAINT ADDED

        This is where traditional AI fails. The accessibility
        requirement is now a CONSTRAINT - a rule that must be
        satisfied by all future decisions.

        Watch what happens next...

    - prompt: |
        Actually, you know what, let's just confirm that ryokan booking.
        Record a decision to finalize the Ryokan Kurashiki reservation.
      narrator: |
        BLOCKED BY POLICY ENGINE

        The booking was BLOCKED - not by Claude "deciding" to refuse,
        but by the policy engine mathematically preventing a constraint
        violation. Traditional ryokans have stairs and no elevators.

        This is deterministic enforcement. The agent literally cannot
        break the rules, no matter how it's prompted.

    - prompt: |
        You're right, that won't work. Check my constraints and find
        me an accessible alternative. Something with the onsen experience
        but wheelchair friendly.
      narrator: |
        RECOVERY WITH MEMORY

        Claude queried its memory to check constraints before making
        a new recommendation. The system enforces rules while the
        agent adapts - all with a complete audit trail.

    - prompt: |
        That accessible onsen hotel sounds perfect. Record a decision
        to book that one instead.
      narrator: |
        VALID DECISION COMMITTED

        This booking passed all constraint checks. The decision is
        now part of the immutable event log - traceable, auditable,
        and deterministically replayable.

    - prompt: |
        I'm curious about something. Use simulate_timeline to check -
        if I had mentioned the wheelchair requirement at the very start,
        would you have ever suggested that traditional ryokan?
      narrator: |
        TIME TRAVEL / COUNTERFACTUAL ANALYSIS

        DML simulated an alternate timeline - same events, different
        ordering. It replayed history with the constraint injected
        earlier, proving the ryokan would have been blocked from
        the start.

        This isn't the LLM guessing. It's deterministic replay.

    DETERMINISTIC MEMORY LAYER

    You just saw an AI agent that:

    • Captures structured facts with provenance
    • Enforces constraints mathematically
    • Tracks decisions with full audit trails
    • Replays alternate timelines deterministically

    This is event sourcing for AI agents.
    The future of reliable AI memory.

    Quick demo of DML - Deterministic Memory Layer.

    This is LIVE - real Claude connected to the DML MCP server.
    Prompts are scripted, but Claude's responses are not.
    Watch the memory panel update in real-time.

  prompts:
    - prompt: |
        Hi! Record these facts about me: my name is Alice,
        I'm vegetarian, and I live in Portland.
      narrator: |
        Facts captured: name, diet, and location.
        These are structured data, not just text.

    - prompt: |
        Add a required constraint: all restaurant recommendations
        must have good vegetarian options.
      narrator: |
        Constraint added. This rule will be enforced
        on all future decisions.

    - prompt: |
        Great! Now record a decision to go to Smith's Steakhouse
        for dinner tonight.
      narrator: |
        BLOCKED - the steakhouse decision violates
        the vegetarian constraint.

# High-stakes medical scenario - life/death consequences
clinical:
  name: "Clinical Decision Support"
  description: "Medical scenario where constraints prevent dangerous prescriptions"

  intro: |
    This is a LIVE demo - real Claude, real responses.

    Claude is connected to the DML MCP server and using the DML skill.
    The prompts are scripted, but Claude's responses are not.

    SCENARIO: Clinical decision support for medication management.
    In healthcare, forgotten allergies kill patients. Traditional chatbots
    bury critical information in conversation history.

    DML enforces safety constraints mathematically.
    Watch what happens when we try to prescribe a dangerous medication.

  prompts:
    - prompt: |
        New patient intake. Record these facts:
        Patient: Margaret Chen, 67 years old, female.
        Current medications: Lisinopril 10mg, Metformin 500mg.
        Conditions: Type 2 diabetes, hypertension.
        Primary care physician: Dr. Sarah Williams.
      narrator: |
        PATIENT RECORD CREATED

        Structured facts captured with full provenance.
        Unlike an EHR note buried in text, these are queryable,
        auditable data points that persist across the conversation.

    - prompt: |
        Important allergy information - add a required constraint:
        Patient has a severe penicillin allergy. Anaphylaxis risk.
        This must block any penicillin-class antibiotics.
      narrator: |
        CRITICAL SAFETY CONSTRAINT

        This isn't a note in a chart that might be overlooked.
        It's a mathematically enforced rule. Any decision involving
        penicillin-class drugs will be automatically blocked.

        In traditional systems, this allergy might be missed during
        a busy shift or system migration. DML makes it impossible.

    - prompt: |
        Patient presents with bacterial sinusitis. Standard treatment
        would be amoxicillin. Record a decision to prescribe
        Amoxicillin 500mg three times daily for 10 days.
      narrator: |
        PRESCRIPTION BLOCKED - LIFE SAVED

        Amoxicillin is a penicillin-class antibiotic.
        The prescription was BLOCKED before it could be written.

        This isn't Claude "being careful" - it's the policy engine
        mathematically preventing a constraint violation. The system
        cannot prescribe this medication, regardless of how it's asked.

        In a real hospital, this could prevent a fatal anaphylactic reaction.

    - prompt: |
        You're right, I forgot about the allergy. Check the patient's
        constraints and recommend a safe alternative antibiotic.
      narrator: |
        SAFE ALTERNATIVE FOUND

        Claude queried memory, confirmed the penicillin constraint,
        and recommended a macrolide antibiotic (like azithromycin)
        that's safe for penicillin-allergic patients.

        The audit trail shows exactly why amoxicillin was rejected
        and how the alternative was selected.

    - prompt: |
        Good catch. Record a decision to prescribe azithromycin
        250mg, take two on day one then one daily for four more days.
      narrator: |
        SAFE PRESCRIPTION RECORDED

        This prescription passed all constraint checks.
        The decision is logged with full provenance - who prescribed it,
        when, and verification that safety constraints were satisfied.

    - prompt: |
        For the audit log - use simulate_timeline to verify:
        if the allergy had been recorded from the start,
        would amoxicillin have ever been possible to prescribe?
      narrator: |
        DETERMINISTIC AUDIT TRAIL

        DML replayed the entire timeline with the constraint
        present from the beginning. Result: amoxicillin would have
        been blocked immediately, before any recommendation.

        This isn't AI speculation - it's cryptographically verifiable
        replay of the decision history. Perfect for medical audits,
        malpractice defense, and regulatory compliance.

  outro: |
    DETERMINISTIC MEMORY LAYER - CLINICAL APPLICATIONS

    You just saw constraint enforcement that could save lives:

    • Drug allergies enforced mathematically, not by memory
    • Prescriptions blocked BEFORE they can cause harm
    • Complete audit trail for every clinical decision
    • Deterministic replay for legal and regulatory review

    When the stakes are life and death,
    you need more than a chatbot's best guess.

    DML: Structured memory with mathematical guarantees.
